# Paw Points at Gray Skies Cafe
The LoyaltyProgram application is a simple Java program that simulates a vending machine for dog-related items, allowing customers to log in, add new customers, view available items, purchase items using loyalty points, and check their Paw Points balance. It uses the DAO (Data Access Object) pattern to interact with a PostgreSQL database for managing customer and item data. 
Customers can redeem points by entering a loyalty code and select items for purchase, with the program updating their points balance and item quantities accordingly.
